         <p>
            We often get questions about which cooking utensils are best to make the best pancakes, so we decided to compile a list of our favourite kitchen tools!
            You can still make amazing pancakes without the specific items we mention, but it's just here as a resource if you ever want to replace or upgrade what you already own!

          Non Stick Pan
        </h2>

        <p>
            No matter which brand, a nonstick pan is essential for making the perfect pancake.
            We love the Samuel Groves tri-ply stainless steel ceramic frying pan (available <a href="https://www.brandalley.co.uk/15942433.html?utm_source=cj&utm_medium=affiliates&utm_campaign=4766554&cjevent=9eee779ec3f311eb819b00230a180513">here</a>), but if you're looking for an afforadable option, Ikea makes an amazing non-stick pan, which performs much better than its price might suggest. Buy it <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/trovaerdig-frying-pan-golden-brown-60270169/">here.</a>

            Silicone Spatula
        </h2>
            <img src="./spatula.png" alt="image of spatula" class="resize">
            <p>
                A silicone spatula is a must for easy fliping of your pancakes! Any silicone spatula will work, but we've tried and tested the OXO Good Grips Silicone Flexible Pancake Turner, and it's easily available <a href= "https://www.amazon.co.uk/OXO-Good-Grips-Silicone-Flexible/dp/B000ND5CBG">here</a> on Amazon! Simple!

            Mixing Bowls

                <p>
                    We're all guilty of having too many of one thing or another in our kitchens, and I'm afraid it's mixing bowls for me! I like to buy pretty ones that are both functional and decorative. Why not treat yourself to a Mason Cash bowl (available <a href="https://www.masoncash.co.uk/2001005-cane-s18-mixing-bowl-26cm/">here</a>) and pretend you're a contestant on the Great British Bake Off?
