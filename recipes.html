        <h3>
        Ingredients
        </h3>
        <p>200g self-raising flour <br>
            1 ½ tsp baking powder<br>
            1 tbsp golden caster sugar<br>
            3 large eggs<br>
            25g melted butter, plus extra for cooking<br>
            200ml milk<br>
            vegetable oil, for cooking<br>
            <br>
            To serve<br>
            maple syrup
            toppings of your choice, such as cooked bacon, chocolate chips, blueberries or peanut butter and jam
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>

        <h3>
            Method
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>STEP 1</b><br>
            Mix 200g self-raising flour, 1 ½ tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp golden caster sugar and a pinch of salt together in a large bowl.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 2</b><br>
            Create a well in the centre with the back of your spoon then add 3 large eggs, 25g melted butter and 200ml milk.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 3</b><br>
            Whisk together either with a balloon whisk or electric hand beaters until smooth then pour into a jug.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 4</b><br>
            Heat a small knob of butter and 1 tsp of oil in a large, non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. When the butter looks frothy, pour in rounds of the batter, approximately 8cm wide. Make sure you don’t put the pancakes too close together as they will spread during cooking. Cook the pancakes on one side for about 1-2 mins or until lots of tiny bubbles start to appear and pop on the surface. Flip the pancakes over and cook for a further minute on the other side. Repeat until all the batter is used up.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 5</b><br>
            Serve your pancakes stacked up on a plate with a drizzle of maple syrup and any of your favourite toppings. <br>

        <h3>
            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <p>
            140g plain flour<br>
            200ml whole milk<br>
            2 eggs<br>
            25g unsalted butter, melted, plus a little extra for greasing<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
       
        <h3>
            Method
        </h3>
        <p> 
            <b>STEP 1</b><br>
            Sift the flour with a pinch of salt into a medium-size bowl and make a well in the middle. Mix the milk and 100ml of water together. Break the eggs into the well and start whisking slowly. Add the milk and water in a steady stream, whisking constantly and gradually incorporating the flour as you do so.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 2</b><br>
            Whisk until the batter is smooth and all the flour has been incorporated. Set the batter aside to rest for 30 mins, then whisk the melted butter into the batter.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 3</b><br>
            Heat the pan over a medium heat. Very lightly grease the pan with melted butter. Using a ladle, pour roughly 2 tbsp of batter into the pan and swirl it around so the bottom of the pan is evenly coated. You want to use just enough batter to make a delicate, lacy pancake. Cook the pancake for about 45 secs on one side until golden and then using a palette knife or fish slice, flip the pancake over and cook the other side for about 30 secs until it freckles.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 4</b><br>
            Slide the pancake out of the pan and either serve immediately or stack on a plate with baking parchment in between. Continue until all the batter is used up.<br>

        <h3>
            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <p>
            1½ cups all-purpose flour<br>
            ½ cup warm water<br>
            3 tablespoons peanut/vegetable oil<br>
            3 each scallions<br>
            1 teaspoon salt<br>
            <br>

            <br>
        </p>
       
        <h3>
            Method
        </h3>
        <p> 
            <b>STEP 1</b><br>
            Oil a large mixing bowl and set aside.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 2</b><br>
            In a separate large bowl, mix together flour and water until a smooth dough forms. If the dough is sticky, add more flour and mix again.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 3</b><br>
            Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 minutes. Place the dough in the greased mixing bowl and turn until it is lightly covered with oil. Cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rest for 30 minutes.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 4</b><br>
            Flour your work surface again and roll out the rested dough. Divide the dough in half, then roll each half into a 1” thick cylinder. With a pastry scraper or knife, slice the dough into 2” segments. Dust your rolling pin with flour and roll out each segment into a 5” circle.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 5</b><br>
            Lightly brush the top of each circle with peanut oil, about 2 tablespoons total for all the pancakes. Sprinkle with scallions and salt.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 6</b><br>
            Roll up each circle into another cylinder, making sure the scallions stay in place.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 7</b><br>
            Coil the dough so that it resembles a snail.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 8</b><br>
            With the rolling pin, flatten again into disks about ¼ inch thick. Place the rolled-out pancakes on a plate and repeat with the remaining dough. Can freeze the dough for future use.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 9</b><br>
            Heat a nonstick saute pan over high heat and add 1 tablespoon oil. Working in batches, pan-fry the pancakes until golden brown. Press down puffed up sides or middle with the spatula, if necessary.<br>
            <br>
            <b>STEP 10</b><br>
            Transfer the pancakes to a plate, cut into wedges, and serve with chili sauce, soy sauce or vinegar on the side.<br>
